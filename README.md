Proximity voice chat for Hogwarts Legacy multiplayer (HogWarp)

## Hey why is the server not a plugin?
The server is currently only a test, it'll be made into a plugin for HogWarp servers soon

## Why is there so much bloat?
Honestly I just accumulate so much random boilerplate code over time. Feel free to clean it up.

## Debug Mode
To enable debug mode (for the web interface) run the following in the browser console.

```js
window.localStorage.setItem("debug", "true")
```
